## Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct
>> This code of conduct provides guidance on participation in Amazon-managed open source communities, outlines the process for reporting unacceptable behavior, and documents consequenes for unacceptable behavior. As an organization and community, we are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone.

## Our Pledge:

>> We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our communities a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

>> We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy communities.

>> We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community. If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so. We seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community.

## Our Standards:
>> As contributors, members, or bystanders we each individually have the responsibility to behave professionally and respectfully at all times. We are kind to others and careful in the words that we choose.

> Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our communities include, but are not limited to:
1. Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
2. Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
3. Giving and gracefully accepting constructive and actionable feedback
4. Accepting accountability and responsibility, apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
5. Prioritizing the health and well-being of the overall community over individual actions
